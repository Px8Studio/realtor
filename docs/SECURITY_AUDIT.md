# Security Issues Found and Recommendations

## Critical Issues Fixed:

### 1. Input Sanitization
- **Issue**: User inputs were not sanitized, allowing potential XSS attacks
- **Fix**: Added input sanitization utility functions
- **Location**: `src/utils/security.js` and updated Contact component

### 2. Email Link Security
- **Issue**: Email links constructed with unsanitized user input
- **Fix**: Added URL encoding and sanitization for email parameters

### 3. Environment Variables
- **Issue**: Sensitive config exposed in tracked .env.local
- **Fix**: Created .env.example template and updated .gitignore

## Additional Security Recommendations:

### 4. Content Security Policy (CSP)
Add CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks:
```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';">
```

### 5. Firebase Security Rules Review
Your current rules are decent but consider:
- Adding size limits for document fields
- Implementing rate limiting
- Adding more granular user permissions

### 6. Image Upload Security
- Validate file types and sizes
- Scan uploaded images for malicious content
- Use Firebase Storage security rules

### 7. Authentication Security
- Implement password strength requirements
- Add email verification
- Consider 2FA for admin users

### 8. Data Validation
- Add server-side validation with Firebase Functions
- Validate all user inputs on both client and server
- Implement proper error handling

### 9. HTTPS Enforcement
- Ensure all communications use HTTPS
- Add HSTS headers in production

### 10. Logging and Monitoring
- Implement security event logging
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Set up alerts for security incidents

## Immediate Actions Required:

1. ✅ Move .env.local to .env.example and create a new .env.local with your actual values
2. ✅ Add input sanitization (implemented)
3. ✅ Fix email link construction (implemented)
4. ⏳ Review and update Firebase security rules
5. ⏳ Add CSP headers to index.html
6. ⏳ Implement proper error handling throughout the app

## Medium Priority:

1. Add form validation libraries (e.g., react-hook-form with yup)
2. Implement rate limiting on forms
3. Add proper loading states and error boundaries
4. Consider using Firebase Functions for sensitive operations

## Long Term:

1. Security audit and penetration testing
2. Implement proper logging and monitoring
3. Add automated security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
4. Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
